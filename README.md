## Planning:
### üï∞ The PastPort Project
**What if you can witness the building of the Great Pyrimid with your own eyes?** 
What if you can say good bye to a loved one that you never got a chance to? Or walk in the streets in Paris when it was a movable feast, alongside with Hemingway and Fitzgerald?

Fundraiser Purpose: Users pledge money to gain access to the time machine for a personal trip to the past 

### Intended Audience

- **History Enthusiasts** ‚Äì who want to witness key moments in history firsthand, from the signing of the Declaration of Independence to the invention of sliced bread.  
- **Regret Fixers** ‚Äì individuals seeking to right past wrongs, make different choices, or prevent themselves from sending that one embarrassing text.  
- **Investors in Science & Adventure** ‚Äì people who believe in pushing humanity beyond the limits of physics (and who also enjoy bragging about funding ‚Äúfaster-than-light‚Äù travel).  
- **Thrill Seekers** ‚Äì daredevils eager to experience warp-speed nausea and the risk of minor to severe temporal paradoxes.  
- **Celebrity Time-Tourists** ‚Äì *"I just want to take a selfie from 1923 and post it on intagram"*
